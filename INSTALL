Installing from source
----------------------

Requirements for source compilation
-----------------------------------

You need the following packages:
  * g++ compiler (see: http://gcc.gnu.org)
  * pkgconfig (see: http://pkg-config.freedesktop.org)
  * X11 (include and libraries) (see: http://wiki.x.org/wiki)
  * Gtk-2.x (include and libraries) (see http://www.gtk.org)
  * Cairo-1.x (include and libraries) (see: http://cairographics.org/)
  * ALSA-1.x (include and libraries) (see: http://www.alsa-project.org/)
  * gettext (see: http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html)

If you want the immediate help you need further:
  * yelp Is part of the GNOME project (see: http://www.gnome.org; package gnome-extra)
  * xmlto (see: http://cyberelk.net/tim/xmlto)
  * xml2pot, po2xml from kdesdk package (http://www.kde.org)
     GNOME users: Many distributions offer a package kdesdk-utils which includes
	 both programs but has (almost) no further KDE dependencies

xmlto in turn requires:
  * docbook-xsl-stylesheets (see: http://wiki.docbook.org/topic/DocBookXslStylesheets)
  * docbook-xml-dtd (see: http://www.docbook.org/xml)


Building
--------

  tar -xvzf nted-x.y.z.tgz

  cd nted-x.y.z

  ./configure

If you want to install NtEd in a certain directory use:

  ./configure --prefix=<installation_path>

If you want to install the docs into a special directory, add
--docdir=... and/or --htmldir=... to the configure line.

If you have trouble with the documentation creation:

  ./configure --without-doc

Type:

  make

This should create NtEd

Type (as root):

  make install

This should install NtEd

If you don't like NtEd type (as root):

  make uninstall

This should remove NtEd

Then start the program type:

         nted

or:

     nted <file>.ntd

This should start the score editor.

First test
----------

File-->Open examples/example1.ntd

or:

File-->Open examples/example2.ntd

Press the play button You should see running red notes ans you should
hear the music. If you hear the music the
program works :-))

If not then try to change the MIDI port (
Configure-->Configure MIDI 
select a port)

If nothing helps refer to the appropriate question in FAQ.
