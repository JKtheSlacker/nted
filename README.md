This is my 'fork' of the nted sheet music editor. As it appears that the
original author doesn't intend to continue maintaining nted[1], I've created
this repository in order to make bugfixes and add features as I see fit.

The first feature I'll be focusing on is adding an ABC exporter. The ABC
file format is a fairly straightforward textual representation of music
files, and is used extensively in the Lord of the Rings Online
community.

Other future development plans:
* ABC Importer
* Fix a bug I've discovered where some MIDI files crash NtEd
