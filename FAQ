*A.1.*

I can't hear any sound! I see the running red notes but there is no
sound! What's wrong?

**

This has nothing to do with NtEd! It is a problem of your MIDI device!
All MIDI based applications (for instance kmid (not kmidi!!!) or
pmidi) will fail!

First of all: Try to play a MIDI file with kmid (not (!!!)). As
long as kmid does not produce any sound, NtEd (and any other MIDI device
based software) will not produce any sound, too! The reason is: Either
your soundcard has no hardware MIDI synthesizer or it has a hardware
MIDI synthesizer but it is not supported by Linux.

Please refer to the ALSA project page (http://www.alsa-project.org) to
find out whether the midi device on your sound card is supported.

Before making a lot of effort to emulate the hardware synthesizer by
software you should search for a soundfont file on the CD shipped with
your soundcard. A soundfont file has the suffix ".sf2" or ".SF2". Please
make sure it is a General MIDI soundfont! If there is such a soundfont
file there is a high probability you simply have to load the soundfont
onto your soundcard.

To to this you need a programm called asfxload

    http://www.alsa-project.org/~tiwai/awedrv.html#Utils

Simply type:

 asfxload <soundfont>.sf2

But even if you cannot find a soundfont file on soundcard CD, you can
try to download a soundfont file. I recommand the soundfont mentioned at
http://alsa.opensrc.org/8MBGMSFX.SF2.

If asfxload fails your soundcard does not permit loading a soundfont.

There is still a last chance that not all needed moduls are loaded. So
as a last attempt type as root:

 modprobe snd_seq_midi

and repeat the asfxload command.

If asfxload fails again you have to emulate the hardware MIDI
synthesizer by software.
This works if your computer has enough performance. Windows for
instances starts a soft synthesizer automatically if the hardware
synthesis does not work. So, be not confused if you can play MIDI files
on Windows!

Such emulation software exists for Linux, too. But it is more
complicated because:

    * You have to start this software "by hand".

    * These software MIDI synthesizers need a so-called soundfont, a
      collection of sample tones of every instrument of a virtual
      orchestra. These soundfonts are copyrighted, i.e. actually nothing
      for a free system like Linux.

But there is a (relatively bulky) way! See The TiMidity server section
in NtEd documentation:

http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/~jan/noteedit/NTED/doc/timidity_server.html

for detailed instructions!

Note! There are more software synthesizers on Linux, which can be
tested. Among them the FluidSysth (http://fluidsynth.resonance.org/trac).

See http://www.linux-sound.org for a list.

      Note

  You should avoid soft synthesis if the performance of your computer is
  too small! The antialiasing procedure (smoothing the symbols) of NtEd
  consumes a lot of performance, and soft synthesis, too! As a result the
  replay can be uneven especially during page turn over!

*A.2*
I use TiMidity but the sound is distorted and somtimes I have no sound, at all. What's wrong?

**

Check whether you have a command pulseaudio:

     which pulseaudio

If you get the path of pulseaudio then follow the instructions in chapter
"pulseaudio"

*A.3.*

At program start it says: "Error in FT_Open_Face"! What's wrong!

**

You have not installed the program! Please type (as root):

  make install

Refer also to INSTALL file shipped with the |nted-x.y.z.tgz| archive.

*A.4.*

I use asfxload but I get an error "sfxload: no memory left" and some instruments are missing during replay. What's wrong?

**

Don't believe the many rumours on different mailing lists!xi
I have bad news for you: You have to build a new kernel. Terrible, I know!
If you feel unable to do this then try to use the TiMidity server.

Otherwise download the kernel and change in

          arch/x86/include/asm/dma.h:

#define MAX_DMA32_PFN ((4UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) >> PAGE_SHIFT)

against:

#define MAX_DMA32_PFN ((2UL * 1024 * 1024 * 1024) >> PAGE_SHIFT)

Then build the kernel! Refer to
https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/universe-bugs/2009-March/068812.html
for more details!

*A.5.*

I cannot install NtEd because I have no root rights. What shall I do?

**

You can use the --prefix option to install the NtEd in an arbitrary
directory below your $HOME directory. Please refer also to INSTALL file!

Furthermore, if you want to avoid the make install command then set
an environment variable NTED_FONT_DIR to the directory where the
nted/ntedfont.pfa is situated.

For instance, assume the ntedfont.pfa is at
/home/smith/datafiles/nted/ntedfont.pfa type at command prompt:

export NTED_FONT_DIR=/home/smith/datafiles

if you have a bash or sh shell.

If you're using a csh or tcsh type:

setenv NTED_FONT_DIR /home/smith/datafiles

To find out your shell type:

echo $SHELL

at command promt.

*A.6.*
May I set lyrics as text blocks below the sheet music? How can I use the score in common texts? 

**

This would require to write a musical score editor and a text editor! This is too complex! But have a look at:

   http://vsr.informatik.tu-chemnitz.de/staff/jan/nted/use_nted_in_text.xhtml

There you can find some proposals about that topic.

*A.7.*

During program startup I get an error: "Cannot open ALSA MIDI sequencer -->
replay won't work ..."! What's wrong ?

**

That means you either have no ALSA sound system. Or you have an ALSA sound
system but for complicated reasons your ALSA midi sequencer is not initialized.
In many cases this is due to a missing module. Therefore try (as root):

  modprobe snd-seq-midi

and restart NtEd.

*A.8.*

During make step an error occurs: /bin/sh: gdk-pixbuf-csource: command
not found|. What's wrong ?

**

You are a SuSE-Linux user! SuSE places this tool at /opt/gnome/bin.
Actually this should be in your PATH. But under certain circumstances
this is not the case. If so then make sure /opt/gnome/bin is in your
PATH. If you have a (t)csh shell type:

setenv PATH "$PATH:/opt/gnome/bin"

If you have another shell type:

export PATH=$PATH:/opt/gnome/bin

To determine your shell type:

echo $SHELL

*A.9.*

During configure step I get an error:
"configure: error: C++ compiler cannot create executables,
See `config.log' for more details.".
What's wrong!

**

Ok, you can inspect the config.log. But this is presumably superfluous,
because in most cases that means: You have no C++ compiler installed.
