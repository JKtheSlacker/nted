Here is some information about the 11 examples, to enable a
copyright-free estimation:

First of all: I (J.Anders <ja@informatik.tu-chemnitz.de> wrote down all
these notes. I wrote all notes from my remembrances, not from
a sheet of paper. So the notes are not copies of some printed notes.
And I declare I'll never demand any copyright.

Of course I'm not the composer! Thus, the question is: Does any
composer hold a copyright? I think this isn't the case because
according to (German) copyright law the copyright ends 70 years
after the composer died. And this is the case here.

I'll tell something about the examples to give
others the opportunity to find out whether the examples
are copyright free:

example1.ntd, example2.ntd, example11.ntd:

  This is a jazz variant of the famous Barcarole from the opera
  "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" ("The Tales of Hoffmann") by Jacques Offenbach.

  Offenbach died 5 October 1880.

  As a child I heard a big band playing this song this way.
  But note: I never saw any notes.

example3.ntd

  This is the famous Bouree e - minor (BWV Nr. 996) by
  Johann Sebastian Bach who died 28 July 1750.

  see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bach

  I can play this without any notes on guitar. I don't
  know from which notes I learned it.  I simply wrote down
  what I'm playing.

  You can find the notes at many places in Internet:

example4.ntd

  This is an Irish folk song called "Oh danny boy". Again as a child
  I heard a big band playing the song this way. But I never saw
  any notes.

  To hear a MIDI example look here:

  (you'll hear I made some mistakes, the exact melody differs from
   my version, another indication: It is written down from my
   remembrances)

  Actually the song is by Frederic Edward Weatherly (1848-1929).
  But he only wrote the lyrics to an unsuccessful song called
  "Danny Boy". As he heard an old song called "Londonderry Air"
  he found the words fit exactly to the music. So he used the
  melody of "Londonderry Air" for his song "Danny Boy".

  Therefore the  question is: Where does the melody of "Londonderry Air"
  come form:

  It was first published 1855 in "Ancient Music of Ireland" by the
  collector George Petrie (1789-1866) as untitled melody, who
  claimed he had written down it from an itinerant piper.

  The whole story about this song is at:

   This is a Celtic/Irish folk song known as

     "Kilgary Mountain"

   or
     
     "Whiskey In The Jar"

   (I changed some notes and added my own finish)

example7.ntd:

   This is the famous "Huntmen's Chorus" ("Jaegerchor") from
   the opera "The Freeshooter" ("Der Freischuetz") by

example8.ntd:

   This song is called "Old folks at home", also known
   as "Suwanee River".

    by Johann Sebastian Bach who died 28 July 1750.

    I could play this on piano and wrote down what I'm playing as
    I developed "NoteEdit". What you see here is the MusicXML import
    from MusicXML created by "NoteEdit".

example10.ntd:

    This is a German folk song:

        "Es wollt ein Schneider wandern"

    first published in Stuttgart, 1850. You can find
    the text, the melody, and the history on many WEB sites,
